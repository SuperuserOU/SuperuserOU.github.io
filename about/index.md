## About

We offer two services:

## Log Collection and Centralization to SIEM

Superuser OÜ is an SIEM onboarding consultancy specializing in log collection involving Splunk and Elastic.

### Log Collection and Log Monitoring

We work with your team to develop a log collection/centralization and log monitoring strategy and implementation plan. This includes:

* Determining which sources to collect events based on the overall system overview.

* Optimization of log collection to decrease subscription and licensing costs with your agent / SIEM.

* Write and tweak the log collection configuration files (whichever chosen log agent is used) targeting log sources.

Since this is an in-depth assignment that targets a very specific part of SIEM onboarding, a singular person dedicated to this portion of the work may provide your team with capacity to focus on other defensive efforts.

Only 1 client is taken on board per year.

### Learn More

The best way to move forwards is to arrange a 30 minute discovery call to determine if our services suit your needs.

## Technical Writer and Technical Evangelist

Superuser OÜ is a technical writing and technical evangelism consultancy specializing in information security.

### API Writing and Documentation

We work with your developer team to surface your API documentation to provide practical value for your developers.

We have experience in REST API documentation, but open to other methods that is implemented by your company.

### Documentation Infrastructure

We offer both setup advisory and implementation services (with limitations).  

We have experience in a number of frameworks including:

* Jinja2 (Python/Django)

Good for templating logic. An example use case could be to use Jinja2 to add dictionary sorting logic to a page that needs to present 100+ different IDs/objects in 5 sets easily.

* Sphinx (for themes)

* ReadTheDocs

* Lint checking tools, such as Pylint/Pocketlint to

* Asciidoc. Pretty heavy duty with many features.

* Frameworks from static site generators - examples are Pelican (python), Jekyll (my site uses this framework).

### B2D Technical Product Writing

With a graduate degree in Information Technology and a Media and Communications undergraduate, as well as practical experience both in marketing, technical marketing and in IT, we offer a knowledgeable perspective for your product beyond the veneer.

These include:

* White Papers
* Technical Data Sheets
* Blog Posts

Only material aimed at developer and technical audiences.
